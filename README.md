## Hello_Jenkins <img align="right" src="img/liatrio.png">
These simple exercises are designed to introduce you to Jenkins and continuous integration. The original exercise 
was written as an exercise for California State University, Chico. I have since modified it to be a simple exercise for
anyone to use. There will be a new version of the exercise that utilizes declarative Jenkinsfiles. 

## Overview
1. [Original Exercise - "Standard Jenkins Jobs"](original/README.md)
2. Declarative Jenkinsfiles _coming soon_. 

#### Prerequisites
A Jenkins server is needed in order to complete the exercise. One option is local virtualization using 
[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/) or a virtual machine. Another is installing Jenkins on a cloud 
platform like AWS. A t2.micro would be more than enough for this particular exercise. I aim to make a single Jenkins
instance strong enough for all exercises that would be part of _Hello Jenkins_.

You should fork this repository and set up to run on your own. This will allow you to change and experiment to your
heart's desire. 

## Something to remember
DevOps is about experimentation. These exercises are not in any way "500 level" class experiments. The goal here is to
experiment with something new that you haven't before and then break it. Fix what you broke. Then break it again. 
You'll learn and who doesn't like breaking stuff??
